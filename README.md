TBD

This package implements a REST interface that exposes available DVID services.  It uses the [DVIDServicesConsole](https://github.com/janelia-flyem/DVIDServicesConsole) as a user-friendly front-end.  A user can launch a DVID service which will run on a Spark cluster.  The server temporarily stores the status of Spark jobs.
